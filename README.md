# Chumbers.io

This is a website I made in the summer of 2021 to host a collection of essays, posts and other content I wrote and am writing.

Check out the site [here](https://chumbers.io).

To make and run a local copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chumb3rs/chumbers.io.git && cd chumbers.io
npm install
npm run dev
```
