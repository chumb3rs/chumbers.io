title: Europe 2023
description: >-
  Documenting the ups and downs of a 10-week voyage around Europe in 2023. Here I'll share what I got up to but most importantly what I enjoyed and learnt along the way in case you too find yourself in any of these cities.

Following my [semester of study exchange at Purdue](/series/purdue-university-2023/1), I had about 2.5 months to kill before I was due back at Monash to continue with my studies. What better way to spend that time than meandering around Europe, exploring dozens of unknown cities and countries?

There was a very loose itinerary - in fact at times, none whatsoever. However, it is safe to say that looking back on those weeks backpacking, they were some of the happiest and most formative that I have had in my young days. They were filled with great discovery, reuniting with old friends not seen in years. But they were also filled with great sadness, and with it, the opportunity to reflect on where I have come from and where I am heading.

For the purposes of you though, my dear reader, what I hope to chart here is a candid retelling of my time in each location. It will be a diet of tourism served mostly through personal anecdote and opinion, with a side dish of objective travel journalism, facts.

Where subjectivity rules, however, so too I hope will the *humble photo*. This trip provided endless opportunities for me to [develop my burgeoning craft of photography](/series/photography/1), though even the most beautiful of coastlines or cityscapes could not at times save my profligacy behind the lens.

Enjoy! And may this never serve as reference for when you too muster the nerve (and funds) to travel to these places.
