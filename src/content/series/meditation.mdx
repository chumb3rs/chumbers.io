> Begin again.

I started meditating shortly after finishing high-school and it is no understatement to say that it is the most important decision I have made since. I really believe that all the good things that have transpired in the meanwhile can be directly attributed to, or were at least enhanced by, this practice.

As is eluded to in my writings on [Heart of Darkness](/series/heart-of-darkness/1), I have long held a fascination with the mind, and it is perhaps not surprising then that I took up meditation so eagerly. But it is more than that as well. Sitting down for 15 minutes or say in the mornings or evenings has become a way of signalling my non-commitment to the frenzies and furor of life.

In this series (which can be read in no particular order), I hope to share some of what I have learnt about meditation, and in doing so, about myself.
