At university, taking pure mathematics units can at times feel like an intentional retreat from reality. Here, the world of politics, social enterprises and humanity in general tends to vanish in the limit to be replaced by abstractions, generalisations and shunting Greek symbols around on a whiteboard[^1]. In many ways, it is this process of entering such a foreign world that is so enticing. But, every now and again, it can be endlessly refreshing to see a tangible application of something that **a priori** seems to have no bearing on the real world. I would like to present one such example I came across in graph theory a few weeks ago.

## Circuits, Cycles, Trails, Walks and Paths

I'm going to assume from here on that you are familiar with the basics of graph theory. However, just to recap ever so briefly, a graph $$G$$ consists of two things:

1. A vertex set $$V(G)$$ which you may like to think of as **nodes** of the graph
2. An edge set $$E(G)$$, which connects two vertices together. An edge $$e\in E(G)$$ is generally written as $$e=uv$$ for two vertices $$u,v \in V(G)$$.

Some testing of LaTeX blocks:
$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

And then there is some more notes after this
