## Hello.

Coming to you today somewhere on the middle of Route 66, heading from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas for a day or two before the trip back to Indianapolis just in time for classes starting back up again after the week off. Spring Break came at a great time, offering a chance to unwind and take in the beautiful landscapes of the American Southwest. More on that to come in next week's edition, but I had a truly special time, the national parks we visited to being everything I could have hoped for and more.

The only downside about the week away was that we were almost perpetually without cell connection, so I was unable to keep up to date with any of the first and second round matchups from March Madness. And as far as Purdue is concerned, safe to say there was...well, quite the upset.

A slightly shorter newsletter today, just owing to the fact that I've had limited time between touring the parks and driving from place to place!

Enjoy the read, I look forward to hearing your thoughts and what you yourself have been getting up to!
