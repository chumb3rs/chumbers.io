## Introduction

This is the first in a series of articles detailing the
**hows**, **whys** and in general grand misadventures I’ve crossed in
making this website. For the technical details, read on ahead. The
following will serve as a nice, holistic overview of what we will be
working towards. I’m assuming that if you are reading this, you are
either:

-   doing so because I begged you to do so and bump up the audience 😘,
    or

-   are yourself interested in making such a personal website yourself.

Let’s also be clear from the jump. This is a completely overdone topic -
there are far better takes on what you are about to read - but
nonetheless I’ve put this together, if only for my benefit to gain some
heightened clarity around the broader project here.

For some time, I had had in mind the plan of creating a site to which
could act as a reservoir for different thoughts, essays and other
miscellaneous pieces of content that I had written over the years.
Despite the clear importance that was to be garnered from such a
platform, <Highlight text="it was something that I persistently put off, with seemingly
every other task rising above it on the priority ladder. This is procrastination in its purest form"/>. It was only after sufficient time
that enough pressure built up behind the valve of postponement to
finally set myself into action. On a side note, one insight I found
useful in arresting my slumber is found in moments like this, from Scott
Young’s
[Ultralearning](https://www.amazon.com.au/Ultralearning-Strategies-Mastering-Skills-Getting/dp/0008305706/ref=sr_1_5?crid=26SGS1PI1W9IG&keywords=ultralearning&qid=1657437202&sprefix=ultralear%2Caps%2C730&sr=8-5).

> My anxiety was that by committing something to paper, there was a good
> chance I might end up writing it poorly. Silly, I know. But most
> motives to procrastinate are silly when you verbalize them, yet that
> doesn’t stop them from ruling your life. Which brings me to the first
> step to overcoming procrastination: recognize when you are
> procrastinating. (Young (2019))

But all this is for another time. The point being was that early in
December 2021 after finishing my university exams for the semester I
[initialised a Git
repository](https://github.com/nickmarks00/chumbers.io)…and then it just
sat there. Because whilst I knew **what** I wanted to build, I did not
yet know **how** I wanted to do it. And if you are new to front-end
development, what you may not appreciate is that in this Wild West,
there [are](https://nextjs.org/) [a](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
[million](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro/)
[ways](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/js/) [to](https://jekyllrb.com/)
[skin](https://ghost.org/docs/) a cat. I’m not even joking.

So to start with, I want to address my decision making process in how I
arrived at my desired tech-stack, and then we’ll dive into what that
tech-stack is. Because the punchline is that I think there is immense
benefit in creating such a platform for yourself. If you are already in
the habit of doing something akin to journaling, then I recommend
migrating this into some sort of web format. People are far more
interested in what you have to say than we can generally anticipate. As
in Kleon (2014),

> A daily dispatch is even better than a résumé or a portfolio, because
> it shows what we’re working on right now. When the artist Ze Frank was
> interviewing job candidates, he complained, “When I ask them to show
> me work, they show me things from school, or from another job, but I’m
> more interested in what they did last weekend.” (Kleon, 2014, p. 48)

Let’s get started.

## Sifting Grain From Chaff

As stated, there are infinite ways to go about this.

### Using an All-In-One/No Code System

If the sole objective of your site is to write content, then this is a
perfectly rational path to take. Arguably, instead of waiting months and
months for my technical bona fides to be good enough to code up this
site, I should have just made something up quickly on a platform like
[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/). There are good videos
documenting how you might do this: may I recommend as a starting point
Nat Eliason (2020), if only for the fact that Nat’s work is a big
inspiration for what I want to build towards in future.

#### Downsides

Well, this part is pretty simple. You lose **a lot** of the flexibility
in terms of design[^1]. Again, this is fine if you are writing articles
with simple text content, even code snippets, but beyond that, from
experience, the interface can be lacking. Take for example attempting to
typeset an article heavy with
$$\LaTeX$$
. This is going to be a frustrating experience, [by all
accounts](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/1636/latex-on-wordpress).
It’s possible with plug-ins, but they muddy the site pretty quickly if
you use too many.

### Frameworks

A lot of these are really good, and to be honest I didn’t try out all of
them[^2] before selecting Next.js.

#### Gatsby JS

Gatsby is a really popular choice for building a static site. With very
little effort, you get access to a well developed framework with lots of
backing, a huge community and an even larger base of plug-ins for adding
any colourful functionality to your website that you might like. There
is no scope for dynamic, client-side rendered content which is clearly
not going to be a serious concern for most blog-style sites. It also
means you’re less likely to get headaches when things go wrong. Simple
is better.

I tried making this exact site using Gatsby first[^3], and to put it
plainly had a lot of issues. This is **less** the fault of Gatsby, and
more the fault of the CMS I chose to use and the subsequent plug-in set
I was using.

![Build errors I persistently got with
Gatsby.](https://res.cloudinary.com/df6vf0noc/image/upload/v1763240697/introduction-to-creating-a-personal-website-with-nextjs/FTddbpjoym_tmlg1m.png)

There is no doubt some way of fixing these errors, but I wasn’t
interested in waiting around. It seemed to be that, coincidentally, I’d
started building just as the new release of Gatsby 4 came out, and many
of the plug-ins I wanted to use weren’t going to be upgraded from
Version 3 for a little while.

#### How To Decide?

Pick a framework in a language you know. If it’s JavaScript, go with
Next.js, Gatsby or Astro. If you know Golang[^4], use Hugo. It’s that
simple. So why did I go with Next.js? To summarise, the drawcards were
that it:

-   ✅ Has **very** easy deployment to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the
    parent company of Next.js. This comes with a nice dashboard and
    analytics. Perhaps the tool I like best, which is certainly not
    unique to Vercel, is that if I’m working on a feature branch and
    commit it with `git push origin my-branch`, instead of deploying
    this build (once successful) to my attached domains (as it does with
    pushes from `main`), Vercel will generate a custom domain at which I
    can view and inspect the build for bugs, etc., before merging into
    production,

-   ✅ Is a very minimal framework, insofar as very few packages were
    required to install from `npm` to get up and running. More on that
    later. This means I got an overall smaller bundle size with Next.js
    than I ever got from Gatsby, successful builds or otherwise.

-   ✅ Has, despite its minimalism, some powerful tools to use for
    adding server-side generation, even as of late incremental static
    regeneration, to my site. This means that when I publish a new post
    from my headless CMS, I **don’t have to** rebuild the site. Certain
    pages will iteratively fetch fresh data from the server and will
    therefore not go stale. <Highlight text="This should be a serious advantage"/> for
    anyone that is intending to publish content frequently as I am.

-   ✅ Allows for you to add a basic `api` to your website written in
    Node.js. This comes in handy later on, when we look at adding
    SEARCH, EMAIL and more complex features to the site.

One thing I would **strongly** recommend against is building this sort
of site with a fully fledged backend like Django or Node. It’s just
simply not necessary, and not worth the pain. It might make for a good
tutorial project, but if this is a site you are serious about, do not
overcomplicate things if you don’t have to.

## Content Management

What about how I should integrate the content I produce into my site?
Well, here again our path forks ten-fold. Let’s work our way up the
complexity ladder, from simplest to most complex (and possibly
over-engineered).

### The Basics

The simplest approach is to write the content in HTML and simply just
drop that into the site. If you do that, it renders something like Next
or Gatsby completely moot. Just some HTML, JavaScript for a bit of
functionality, CSS for styling and you are good to go. This is honestly
a good option if you are just wanting to make a portfolio with only a
few pages. The fallback here is that writing articles in HTML is not
conducive to how the brain likes to write, and its difficult to maintain
since you are not separating concerns: form is merged with design.

### The Less Basic

A fantastic alternative to HTML, but still very much in the same vain,
is to use Markdown. The syntax is super easy to understand for
non-coders, it’s almost universally supported, and it’s quite flexible.
Any flexibility that it doesn’t have out-of-the-box can be added with
MDX (more on this in another article).

You can write your articles as `.md` files and pretty much any static
site framework worth its salt will be able to generate templated pages
for those pieces. This is good news for us, because the template is now
separate from the content, meaning that you can tweak the styling
without worrying about overriding your writing in any sort of way.

### The Less, Less Basic

The last option is to use a headless CMS service. What is a headless
CMS?

> Headless CMS = where your content lives (the body) is detached from
> where the content is presented (the head)

Options here are again aplenty: [Contentful](https://contentful.com),
[Strapi](https://strapi.io), or my choice
[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com), just to name a few. I chose GraphCMS
for its usage of GraphQL to query data, which I’ll cover in a separate
article.

| ✅ Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ❌ Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allows for complex relationships between your content. For instance I’ve created schemas for posts, categories, tags and series                                                                                                                           | Requires some setup and configuration, which can be challenging for beginners. It’s also harder to diagnose when something goes wrong                                  |
| Natively (at least in the case of GraphCMS) provides webhooks through which you can automate complex tasks on the change of content                                                                                                                       | Your work is sitting on someone else’s servers. This means you are at their mercy: if they are doing site maintenance for a few hours, you’re out of luck              |
| Provides a really clean and effective template for producing content. It also means that you can add collaborators, non-coders and so forth to your production side without them having to worry about learning markdown, or anything technical like that | Fetching data from a remote server will likely make your site less performant (that is, fast to load) compared to a website that is just pulling content files locally |

Overall, at least in my case, the trade-offs were outweighed by the
advantages. But that’s not to say this is the correct or best way of
doing it. Such a thing doesn’t exist. I would recommend starting simple
(as I did) and ramping up the complexity **as you need it** (JIT, or
Just In Time), rather than operating from a JIC, or Just In Case
heuristic.

![The heuristics I used in deciding my tech stack.](https://res.cloudinary.com/df6vf0noc/image/upload/v1763240697/introduction-to-creating-a-personal-website-with-nextjs/036B-hUwfV_ovpvh4.png)

### A Disclaimer…

One point I cannot stress enough, and perhaps I am hypocritical in this
regard, is to not over-engineer a project if you don’t have to. One
observes the prevalence of [this sort of
meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxxw3qtb3_g) increasingly in web
development culture, and it objectively does not make for a better
outcome, for the developer nor the end user. Unless, as I initially
conceived of, you want your site to be **a lot more** than just a
repository to house articles and other forms of content, then go with
something simple. If I may recommend, **Local Markdown Files +
Gatsby/Hugo** depending on the languages you are most comfortable with.
If you want to learn Hugo, [check out this
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).

Again, don’t make this so complicated that it never gets done, or cannot
be maintained.

So, with all that aside,

```shell
npx create-next-app my-site
```


And let’s continue.
